		<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<div class="faq-container">
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">You are not a native English speaker. How can I trust your editing and proofreading skills?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer"><p>This is a completely valid concern because English second-language speakers, regardless of their skill and experience in learning the language, may unconsciously make errors while editing, either by missing unidiomatic sentences or by making edits that might sound unnatural to a native speaker.</p>
				<p>This is where I use AI to complete my editing process. The latest large language models are well-trained in standard English and are designed to suggest the most natural idiomatic expressions. Of course, these AI suggestions are thoroughly checked by me to ensure that your meaning and tone remain intact.</p>
				<p>hrough this hybrid human–AI editing approach, you get the best of both worlds: the precision and speed of AI, along with the insightful expertise and discretion of the human mind.</p></div>
				
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">Why can't I just use ChatGPT to edit? Why do I need an "expert human" editor?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer"><p>ChatGPT and similar online AI chatbots are amazing tools and great at writing and editing. However, they do have some limitations. Let's take an example: Consider the sentence  "The definition of 1 coulomb changed with time. At the time of writing, the unit of charge is defined such that the elementary charge value is 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C", which needs to be edited. Here's how ChatGPT 4o responds:</p> <img src="whynotGPT.png" alt="ChatGPT response" class="gptresponse"><p>The edited sentence is grammatically and idiomatically perfect, but here's where the expert human editor can make the critical difference. The edited phrase "As of the time of writing" is fine, but in this context, the definition and value of elementary charge are not subject to frequent changes since they are standard quantities. Although the standards can evolve with advances in science, the phrase used gives the impression that this is frequent occurrence. So, <b>"Currently"</b> is a better alternative. Here's what ChatGPT says when I probe it further:</p> <img src="whynotGPT2.png" alt="ChatGPT response" class="gptresponse-image"></div>
				
			</div>
			
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">How does this "hybrid H-AI" work?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer"><p>Here's the workflow. As the middle part is automated, significant time is saved:</p><img src="workflow.png" alt="ChatGPT response"class="workflow-image"></div>
			</div>
			
<!--
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">What can I except from your editing?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer"><p>Amalgam Editing offers two different types of editing: (1) <b>Fluency</b> and (2) <b>Coherence</b>. Fluency includes basic editing for spelling, grammar, and punctuation; suggestions for context-based vocabulary alternatives; and suggestions for idiomatic sentence structure. Coherence offers document-level check for flow and consistency in addition to all those offered in Fluency. You also have the <b>"+" option</b> (Fluency+ and Coherence+), in which the expert human editor will provide you with detailed comments on explanations for edits, suggestions for alternative sentence structures, and writing tips. Check out the Illustrations section for some examples. </p></div>
			</div>
-->
			
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">What kind of documents do you work on?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer"><p>We work on a wide array of documents, including books, theses, monographs, reports, and research manuscripts. You can let know what type of document at the time of submitting it, and we will customize the editing process accordingly.</p></div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">Should the document be in any specific format</div>
				<div class="faq-answer"><p>There are no constraints on the format. But note that the AI language model has been implemented to work best on raw text (i.e., without any style formatting and mathematical expressions) in <b>Microsoft Word (.DOCX)</b> format. So, it would be ideal to provide us with the .DOCX file, which is also the most popular document format. Even if your document is in a different format, including <b>TEX</b>, no worries... we can handle them too. We will deliver the final edited document in the format of your choice.</p></div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">What about the cost?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer"><p>It is quite challenging to set a fixed price for editing because the content of a document, in general, can vary extensively based on the subject matter, the target audience, the style and tone (such as formal or informal), and writing skill level of the author. So, it is always better to quote a price after taking a look at sample text from the document. 
<!--
				But, if we want to get a rough idea, the following table might help you. We will notify you of any changes in the price quoted for your document, explaining the reasons.   </p></p><img src="pricetable.png" alt="rate list"class="price-image">
-->
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">What if I'm not satisfied with the work?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">If you're not fully satisfied with the initial edit, the editor will conduct a <b>complimentary review process</b>. We'll carefully listen to your specific concerns, discuss the areas where the edit does not meet your expectations, and provide a revised version that precisely addresses your feedback. Our commitment is to ensure you receive a polished document that meets your exact requirements, and this detailed review and refinement process is provided at <b>no additional cost</b> to you. We believe in building long-term relationships with our clients through responsive, client-centered service.</div>
