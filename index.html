		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">Why can't I just use ChatGPT to edit? Why do I need an "expert human" editor?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer"><p>ChatGPT and similar online AI chatbots are amazing tools and great at writing and editing. However, they do have some limitations. Let's take an example: Consider the sentence  "The definition of 1 coulomb changed with time. At the time of writing, the unit of charge is defined such that the elementary charge value is 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C", which needs to be edited. Here's how ChatGPT 4o responds:</p> <img src="whynotGPT.png" alt="ChatGPT response" class="gptresponse"><p>The edited sentence is grammatically and idiomatically perfect, but here's where the expert human editor can make the critical difference. The edited phrase "As of the time of writing" is fine, but in this context, the definition and value of elementary charge are not subject to frequent changes since they are standard quantities. Although the standards can evolve with advances in science, the phrase used gives the impression that this is frequent occurence. So, <b>"Currently"</b> is a better alternative. Here's what ChatGPT says when I probe it further:</p> <img src="whynotGPT2.png" alt="ChatGPT response" class="gptresponse-image"></div>

				<div class="faq-question">How does this work?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer"><p>Here's the workflow. As the middle part is automated, significant time is saved:</p><img src="workflow.png" alt="ChatGPT response"class="workflow-image"></div>

			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">What if I'm not satisfied with the work?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">At Amalgam Editing, customer satisfaction is our top priority. If you're not fully satisfied with the initial edit, the editor will conduct a <b>complimentary review process</b>. We'll carefully listen to your specific concerns, discuss the areas where the edit does not meet your expectations, and provide a revised version that precisely addresses your feedback. Our commitment is to ensure you receive a polished document that meets your exact requirements, and this detailed review and refinement process is provided at <b>no additional cost</b> to you. We believe in building long-term relationships with our clients through responsive, client-centered service.</div>
